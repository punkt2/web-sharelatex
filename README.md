web-sharelatex with LDAP Authentication
==============

web-sharelatex is the front-end web service of the open-source web-based collaborative LaTeX editor,
[ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com).
It serves all the HTML pages, CSS and javascript to the client. web-sharelatex also contains 
a lot of logic around creating and editing projects, and account management.

The rest of the ShareLaTeX stack, along with information about contributing can be found in the 
[sharelatex/sharelatex](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex) repository.
